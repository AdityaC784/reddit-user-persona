Alright, so I need to create a structured user persona for the Reddit user 'kojied' based on the provided posts and comments. Let me start by going through each of the sections outlined in the format and see how I can extract the necessary information.

First, the **Age Range**. I remember seeing a post where the user mentioned feeling out of place among younger people at a bar, referring to themselves as the "old person." That should help estimate their age range. I'll note that down.

Next, **Personality Traits**. The user seems reflective and introspective, especially in the intern season post where they questioned their feelings and compared themselves to others. They also showed a sense of humor and a bit of frustration when dealing with younger crowds. I'll list those traits.

For **Interests**, the user has posted about AR/VR technology, iOS development, and spatial computing. They also discussed movies, NYC life, and even some gaming, so those should be included as interests.

The **Tone of Communication** appears to be curious and analytical, as seen in their questions about H1B holders and their detailed thoughts on ESG ratings. They also seem to enjoy discussing hypothetical scenarios, like the One Piece theory.

Regarding **Political Views**, the user participated in a discussion about banning TikTok in the US, which might hint at some conservative leanings, but it's not explicitly clear. I'll note that observation.

**Frequent Subreddits** include VisionPro, NYC, AskReddit, and others related to tech and gaming. I'll compile a list of those.

I'll make sure to cite specific quotes and provide URLs for each section as required. I should avoid any markdown and keep the output structured as per the example. Let me organize all this information accordingly.
